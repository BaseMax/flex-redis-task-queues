# Flex Redis Task Queues

A python-based web application using **flask** to simulates delay and manage **Queue** by getting from Redis in `rq` worker.

## AIM

I just looking for a purpose and useful reason to use Redis in my projects.

## Using

```
rq worker
flask run
```

> Note: `flask run` will need run.py file, so you have to keep main filename as `run.py`

Next open `http://127.0.0.1:5000/task?n={PUT_ANYTHING}` at your browser.

## Setup

```
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install redis flask rq
```
